# ada-course
*** This repository corresponds to the Front-end Course that I am doing with Ada.
*** There are no folders 6 and 7 because they were the explanation of how to create a 
local repository and how to join it with a repository on Github.
*** Class 15 corresponds to how to create branches and everything related to how to work on branches.
*** There are number of classes that aren't. They correspond to practical work.
